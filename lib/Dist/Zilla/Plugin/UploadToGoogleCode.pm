=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToGoogleCode - upload your dist to Google Code (experimental)

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

If loaded, this plugin will allow the F<release> command to upload to Google Code.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin looks for the Google Code project name in F<dist.ini>, and gets your
Google Code credentials from F<~/.googlecode-identity> (which can be
GnuPG-encrypted; see L<Config::Identity>).

If any configuration is missing, it will prompt you to enter your
username and password during the BeforeRelease phase.  Entering a
blank username or password will abort the release.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 before_release

Checks that we have the data we need to release.

=head2 release

Performs the release using L<Google::Code::Upload>.
