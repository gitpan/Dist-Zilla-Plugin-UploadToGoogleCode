# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToGoogleCode - upload your dist to Google Code (experimental)

# VERSION

version 0.002

# SYNOPSIS

If loaded, this plugin will allow the `release` command to upload to Google Code.

# DESCRIPTION

This plugin looks for the Google Code project name in `dist.ini`, and gets your
Google Code credentials from `~/.googlecode-identity` (which can be
GnuPG-encrypted; see [Config::Identity](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Config::Identity)).

If any configuration is missing, it will prompt you to enter your
username and password during the BeforeRelease phase.  Entering a
blank username or password will abort the release.

# METHODS

## before\_release

## release

# ATTRIBUTES

be looked for in the user's GoogleCode configuration.

## password

[https://code.google.com/hosting/settings](https://code.google.com/hosting/settings)). If not supplied, it will be
looked for in the user's GoogleCode configuration.
